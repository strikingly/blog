{% asset_img andrew.jpg [] %}

We're very excited to welcome Andrew to the frontend development team here at Strikingly!  He comes to us from the world of big red trucks, where he spent multiple years learning how to prevent many things from lighting on fire or burning down.  Between that and keeping the neighborhood alive and healthy, it seems natural that he would try to apply the same care and concern for the websites people use every day.

When he isn't busy bug splatting or putting together new features, you'll probably find him playing with his new daughter or out exploring his new home, Shanghai.  His hobbies and history couldn't prepare him for the scooter in the office, though.  At first sight, he thought “wow this can't be that hard!”  After a nasty spill, he's become quite scared of it.  Run Andrew, Run!
