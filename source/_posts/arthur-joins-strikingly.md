Arthur Wang is our “new” iOS developer. Alright, he is not new.  He has been on this team for more than 1 year. The iOS app [Strikingly](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/strikingly/id892299884?mt=8) is developed by him.

The family name Wang in Chinese means KING, so we literally call him “King Arthur” in Chinese.

He seems like a dumb-ass. He installed more than 500 apps in his iPhone, so trying to find any app in his phone takes him a lot of time, remembering the name of app, remembering the icon of the app, or remembering any clue of the app takes him more than 5 seconds and during that 5 seconds he just stares at screen and does nothing, like a fool.

Oh he uses 1password, randomly generated all his passwords, so he doesn't remember any password as well, like a fool again.

He has many alarm clocks and sets many alarms on his phone, but getting up earlier is still his biggest dream. The most efficient development time for him is at midnight, so if you get locked out of your house in the middle of the night, he would be one guy who probably could save you.

He thinks he is a dumb-ass and learns things the hard way, so what he really wants to do is to tell young people how to avoid the mistakes he has made. But before he thinks he's learned enough to teach people, you won't get benefits from him.

Did I mention he has a twin brother? He has a younger brother (10 mins younger, actually) who looks exactly like him. So if you see someone who looks like him sitting in the Strikingly office, ask his name first.
