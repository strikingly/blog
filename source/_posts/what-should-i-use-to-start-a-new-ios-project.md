# What should I use to start a new iOS project

If you start iOS developing 1 year ago, the question in title would be nonsense, cause you almost don't have any other choices. The best way you can build an iOS app is the way Apple provides. (There actually are many other solutions like RubyMotion with ruby, Xamarin with C#, but let's just keep them out of this conversation, since market shares of these stacks are trivial) Nowadays, even Apple provides 2 stacks for you to develop a new app, Objective-C and Swift.

I want to talk about Objective-C, Swift and mostly React-Native here, that's the main fight occurred in my mind for almost the whole August. I will organize this article from some angles, discuss some pros and cons.
